    Profiles Vocabulary
    
    This vocabulary is for describing relationships between standards/specifications, profiles of them and
    supporting artifacts such as validating resources.  This model starts with
    [http://dublincore.org/2012/06/14/dcterms#Standard](dct:Standard) entities which can either be Base
    Specifications (a standard not profiling any other Standard) or Profiles (Standards which do profile others).
    Base Specifications or Profiles can have Resource Descriptors associated with them that defines implementing
    rules for the it. Resource Descriptors must indicate the role they play (to guide, to validate etc.) and the
    formalism they adhere to (dct:format) to allow for content negotiation. A vocabulary of Resource Roles are
    provided alongside this vocabulary but that list is extensible.
